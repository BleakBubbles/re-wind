# re:wind
 **re:wind** allows us to record snippets of our current lives and save them to look back on in the future when we want a feeling of nostalgia. To use this app, users can hover over the disk reader under the TV screen and click on the open reader to upload a short video, and our systems will process it through AI NLP—by adding retro/nostalgic sound effects that we all know and love from our childhood and a retro filter over the video—and add it to your library. Then, whenever you want to look back at the highlights of your life, you can easily search (by tags) and find memories that will match your desired mood.
